## Overview
Disambiguate with Graphs (DwG) is a Structure from Motion (SfM) pipeline implementing graph-based disambiguation algorithms to reconstruct 3D scenes with ambiguous or repetitive structures.
DwG_SfM is based on the Python SfM pipeline [OpenSfM](https://github.com/mapillary/OpenSfM) developed by Mapillary.
